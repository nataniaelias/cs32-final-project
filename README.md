# cs32-final-project
My CS32 Final Project w/ Eejenn, Lea, and Natania

Description:
We are seeking to improve the popular scheduling tool When2Meet to offer a wider range of functionality, including syncing with Google Calendar, repeated time blocks, and preferences. To sync with the Google Calendar, we will use tools from Chapter 4 on querying to access GCAL and garner a response in JSON Format. For repeated time blocks and preferences, we will prompt the user to input whether their classes/extracurriculars/time commitments repeat and the range of willgness users have to meet at certain times.
